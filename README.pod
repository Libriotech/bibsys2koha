=head1 NAME 

bibsys2koha - scripts for migrating from BIBSYS to Koha

=head1 ABOUT

BIBSYS is a Norwegian ILS, used by academic and special libraries. Koha is the world's first (and coolest) free software ILS. The scripts provided by bibsys2koha are meant to facilitate a migration from BIBSYS to Koha. 

=head1 FILES

Run Perl scripts with the -h option for details about what each script does and what arguments can be supplied.

=over 4

=item * prep.sh - Prepares the files for use with items.pl.

=item * items.pl - Assemble records and item info into a MARCXML file that can be imported into Koha.

=head1 HOW TO USE THIS? 

=over 4

=item 1 Make sure you are in the same directory as the unzipped export from BIBSYS

=item 2 Run prep.sh. This will result in two new files: records.mrk and items.txt. 

=item 3 Convert from .mrk to .mrc by running the line2iso.pl script from LibrioTools ( https://github.com/MagnusEnger/LibrioTools )

=item 4 Run items.pl. This will result in a MARCXML file containing records and items, which can be imported into Koha. 

=item 5 Run bulkmarcimport.pl from Koha. Remember to use the "-m MARCXML" switch. 

=item 6 Run rebuild_zebra.pl from Koha.

=head1 BARCODES

If the library that is being migrated has barcodes connected to DOKIDs, the 
barcodes might not be part of the exported item information, but might come in a 
separate file. This file contains DOKIDs and barcodes separated by a space. To 
change the order of the "columns", something like this might be used:

  awk -v RS="\r" -v FS=" " -v ORS="\n" -v OFS=" " '{print $2,$1}' f1.txt > f2.txt

The resulting file can then be turned into SQL similar to this:

  UPDATE items SET barcode = '<barcode>' WHERE barcode = '<DOKID>';

The resulting SQL file can then be run against the database after the other 
item information has been migrated. 

=head1 TODO

This is a work in progress. Each new migration it is used for reveals some new things that need to be fixed. Here is a list of currently known issues:

=over 4

=item * Merge 571$b into 571$a. (571$b is defined in BIBSYS-MARC, but NORMARC only has 571$a.)
